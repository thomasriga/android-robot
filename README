Java libraries for Amarino (AmarinoLibrary_v0_55.jar) & opencv (opencv-2.3.1.jar) are included in the libs directory. 
A big thanks goes out to the authors: http://www.amarino-toolkit.net, http://opencv.willowgarage.com. 
Include them in your Java build path in the Eclipse project properties. 
Select "Google APIs 4.0.3 API 15" as a build target in the "Android" section of the Eclipse project properties.

Optionally:
Install OpenCV 2.3.1 for Android: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
Install the Android Native Development Kit: http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Make sure that both project directories reside in the same parent directory. The file includeOpenCV.mk links to the header files of the OpenCV project.
Then run ndk-build in the project directory. You need to adjust the Java code, uncommenting the parts that run native code. Your mileage may vary.
